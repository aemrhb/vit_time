Temporal ViT-U-Net Tandem Model
Enhancing Multi-Sensor Land Cover Classification Using Transformer-Based Temporal Encoding of Satellite Image Time Series


üõ∞Ô∏è Overview
This repository contains the official implementation of the Temporal ViT-U-Net Tandem Model, a novel architecture designed for land cover classification using multi-temporal, multi-sensor satellite imagery. The model fuses the Temporal Vision Transformer (ViT) and U-Net in a tandem setup to leverage both temporal patterns and spatial detail for robust semantic segmentation.

The architecture was proposed in the paper:

"Temporal ViT-U-Net Tandem Model: Enhancing Multi-Sensor Land Cover Classification Through Transformer-Based Utilization of Satellite Image Time Series"
